## üá≥üá± Who We Are

In 2021, a small group of part-time contributors dared to dream of transparent solutions for the future of advanced aerial mobility.

Our goal: make VTOL cargo delivery simple and accessible. Instant itinerary creation, with automated flight routing, regional compliance, aircraft selection, and vertiport booking. Schedule deliveries with your fleet (or with aircraft for hire) in just a few taps. Build a vertipad (or a dozen) and get instant reservations from other customers and businesses on the network. Create and configure pricing models and let your assets work for you. Leave the complexities of aerial logistics and compliance to us, so you can take to the sky faster.

In 2024, boosted by stellar results and the generous support of our first investor, our core team officially established Aetheric B.V. in the Netherlands. Learn more at our [website](https://aetheric.nl)!
